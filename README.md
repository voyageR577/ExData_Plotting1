## Introduction

This is Exploratory Data Analysis Week 1 peer-review assignment. In this repository I've included the 4 plots and 4 R scripts to make the plots respectively. Basic requirements can be found on:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/ylVFo/course-project-1
or https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1.

One important thing to note is that, in order for the R script to work so that you can reproduce the plots I've shown you, you will need to keep everything, especiall the dataset that will be used in the plotting, under your working directory. You can either set it before everything else starts, or use the default working directory as R or RStudio provides you with.
Also, for each one of the R script, STEP 1 is exactly the same, as I've decided to use the same processed tidy data to make the plotting in STEP 2. For the sake of saving some time, one thing you can do is to skip STEP 1 and start from STEP 2 if you have everything loaded and settled in your workspace. But you're worried that things might go wrong accidentally, it won't hurt to always start from the beginning every time you open a R script in here.

I hope that you enjoy this short journey with on the road of exploring R, and let me know if you have any comments&feedbacks!
